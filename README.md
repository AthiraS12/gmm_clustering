# GMM Dihedral Clustering

This repository contains a Python implementation for clustering dihedral angle data from molecular dynamics simulations using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).

## Features

- GMM-based clustering of dihedral angles (phi, psi) from trajectory data.
- Model selection using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
- Visualization of clusters in reduced 2D space using PCA.
- Calculation of representative (centroid) frames for each cluster.
- Plotting of cluster percentages and number of structures in each cluster.
